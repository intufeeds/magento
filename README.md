magento
=======

The instructions for installing this script are fairly simple:-

1) Upload the file in the root of the Magento folder
2) If needed change line 14 which says Mage::app('default'); . Replace 'default' with the client's Magento store code. To get the store code go to Admin > System > Manage Stores (or Manage Shops) and click on the relevant store under 'Store View Name' (or 'Shop View Name')
